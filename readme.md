# DES_RAM

this project building descrete event simulation for reliability, availability, and maintainability simulation

## basic idea of software
simulate indestrial system based on thier basic component relaibility performance to predict the 
system performance

## basic idea of program
Idea is building using blocks -- class -- to easy extend software

Initailly this software should capable for simulate series system with one maintenance team 

First, building abstract class to be used as base for all simulation blocks

## setup visual studio code enviroment
for windows follow this link https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw

for mac you can follow link above but istead of using mingw use defualt mac complire that download with xcode
